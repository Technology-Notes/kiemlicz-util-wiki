#Tcpdump
Normally packets received must have destination MAC address equal to NIC's MAC address.
Exceptions:
 1. Broadcast destination: `0xFFFFFFFFFFFF`
 2. Multicast destination: for IPv4 `0x01.....`, for IPv6 `0x3333....`

When does the traffic dumping actually take place:

* Incoming traffic: `wire -> NIC -> tcpdump -> netfilter/iptables -> application`
* Outgoing traffic: `application -> iptables -> tcpdump -> NIC -> wire`
